# Senior Mechanical Engineer

During my time at Tech Corp, I led the design of several key components.

## Key Achievements

-   **Redesigned the main assembly**, reducing weight by 20%.
-   **Implemented automated testing**, cutting validation time by 50%.

## Project Showcase

One of the projects I worked on involved this complex assembly:

<Model3D 
  src="/models/space.glb" 
  height="400px" 
  autoRotate={false}
/>

## Responsibilities

1.  Lead design reviews.
2.  Mentor junior engineers.
3.  Coordinate with manufacturing teams.
