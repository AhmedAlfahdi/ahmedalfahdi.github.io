One-year EIDAAD rotation across pipeline design, construction, and integrity management.

## Overview

**A pipeline** is a closed, pressurized transport system (pipe + fittings + valves + stations) used to move fluids from a source to a destination with minimal handling. In the oil & gas context, pipelines connect **wells → gathering systems → processing plants → storage/terminals → refineries/export**, but the same infrastructure concept also applies to **water**, **steam**, and **industrial chemicals**.

**Pipeline Engineering** covers the full lifecycle of a pipeline system—**concept selection**, **design**, **construction**, **commissioning**, and **integrity management**—to transport fluids safely and economically over long distances.

### What is a pipeline used for?

Common uses include:

- **Crude oil transport**: from fields to export terminals or refineries.
- **Gas transport**: from processing plants to consumers, power generation, or export.
- **Produced fluids**: multiphase flow (oil/gas/water) in gathering networks.
- **Utilities**: water injection, produced-water disposal, and plant/field utilities.
- **Special services**: chemicals (MEG, methanol, inhibitors), slurries, or hot fluids where applicable.

### Why use pipelines?

Compared to trucking or frequent handling, pipelines are typically:

- **Safer**: fewer loading/unloading operations and reduced exposure.
- **Lower OPEX per unit** at scale: efficient continuous transport.
- **More reliable**: steady flow, predictable operations, fewer logistics constraints.
- **Lower environmental footprint** per unit transported (when designed and operated correctly).

### What makes up a pipeline system?

A pipeline is more than pipe-in-the-ground. Typical components include:

- **Line pipe + fittings**: bends, tees, reducers, flanges, etc.
- **Valves & stations**: isolation valves, pig launcher/receiver stations, metering, pumps/compressors.
- **Protection systems**: coating, cathodic protection (CP), electrical isolation, corrosion monitoring.
- **Controls**: instrumentation + SCADA for pressure/flow/alarms and remote operations.
- **Crossings & interfaces**: roads, wadis, rail, existing utilities, tie-ins, and hot taps where required.

In this rotation, my work sat at the intersection of **engineering calculations**, **field execution support**, and **technical documentation**, with strong emphasis on code compliance (ASME B31.4/B31.8) and HSE/QA workflows.

### What does a pipeline engineer typically do?

Core responsibilities often include:

- **Design & analysis**: wall thickness, stability/buckling, buoyancy, road crossings, supports, alignment, and constructability checks.
- **Construction support**: welding/NDT coordination, coating/field joints, lowering-in, hydrotest planning/execution, and as-built documentation.
- **Integrity management**: corrosion threats, mitigation planning, inspection strategies, and fitness-for-service style reviews.
- **Documentation & governance**: ITPs, QA/QC records, AFC/IFC packages, HSE planning, and technical justifications.

### What I focused on during this training

- Produced calculations and drawings aligned with **B31.4/B31.8** expectations and PDO engineering workflows.
- Supported field execution activities (hydrotest + NDT) by translating requirements into checklists, documentation, and practical steps.
- Assisted concept-stage work (route/cost studies) and flow simulation tasks (PIPSIM, Pipeline Studio, OLGA) to connect **process assumptions** to **mechanical design** constraints.

## Highlights
- Produced design calculations (wall thickness, buoyancy, upheaval buckling, road crossings) and alignment drawings to ASME B31.4/B31.8.
- Supported construction workflows: hydrostatic testing, NDT coordination, HSE plan, QA/QC, ITP, AFC docs.
- Contributed to concept studies (CAPEX/OPEX, route selection) and flow simulations (PIPSIM, Pipeline Studio, OLGA).
- Performed material and corrosion assessments and integrity reviews.

## Tools & Skills
- Pipeline design + integrity, ASME B31.4/B31.8.
- Hydrotesting, NDT coordination, QA/QC documentation.
- Flow simulation (PIPSIM, Pipeline Studio, OLGA); cost/route studies.
