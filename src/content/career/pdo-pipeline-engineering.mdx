One-year EIDAAD rotation across pipeline design, construction, and integrity management.

## Highlights
- Produced design calculations (wall thickness, buoyancy, upheaval buckling, road crossings) and alignment drawings to ASME B31.4/B31.8.
- Supported construction workflows: hydrostatic testing, NDT coordination, HSE plan, QA/QC, ITP, AFC docs.
- Contributed to concept studies (CAPEX/OPEX, route selection) and flow simulations (PIPSIM, Pipeline Studio, OLGA).
- Performed material and corrosion assessments and integrity reviews.

## Tools & Skills
- Pipeline design + integrity, ASME B31.4/B31.8.
- Hydrotesting, NDT coordination, QA/QC documentation.
- Flow simulation (PIPSIM, Pipeline Studio, OLGA); cost/route studies.
