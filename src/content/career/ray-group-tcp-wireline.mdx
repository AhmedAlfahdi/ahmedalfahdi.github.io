## What was this role about?

Six-month specialized training program in tubing conveyed perforating (TCP) and wireline operations for oil & gas well completion and intervention services. The training provided comprehensive exposure to downhole explosive technologies, formation evaluation techniques, and well intervention methodologies across both onshore conventional and enhanced oil recovery operations.

Key focus areas included:
- **TCP operations**: Shaped charge design, explosive handling, perforating gun assembly, and deployment procedures
- **Wireline services**: Open-hole and cased-hole logging, real-time data acquisition, and formation evaluation
- **Well intervention**: Plug setting, fishing operations, remedial perforating, and production optimization
- **Safety protocols**: High explosive handling procedures, regulatory compliance, and risk assessment methodologies
- **Technical analysis**: Perforation design optimization, charge selection criteria, and post-job evaluation

The program combined theoretical knowledge of explosive physics and downhole tool mechanics with hands-on field operations at active well sites, providing practical experience in both routine completion work and complex intervention scenarios typical of mature oil field operations.

## Highlights
- Designed and executed TCP operations using shaped charge technology for reservoir access and flow optimization.
- Performed wireline logging operations (open-hole and cased-hole) for formation evaluation and well integrity assessment.
- Handled high explosives (HMX, RDX, PETN) following strict safety protocols and regulatory compliance procedures.
- Supported well intervention services including perforating, plug setting, fishing operations, and remedial work.
- Assembled TCP strings (gun systems, firing heads, packers/BPVs) following HES procedures.
- Assisted fiber-optic perforation setups and pre-job readiness checks/documentation.
- Coordinated readiness checks, tool string prep, and onsite QA for field deployments.

## Tools & Skills
- TCP system design and deployment; shaped charge selection and positioning.
- Wireline operations (logging, intervention); explosive handling and safety protocols.
- Formation evaluation and well completion optimization; real-time data acquisition and analysis.
- Fiber-optic perforation prep; safety-first execution; documentation and pre-job checklists.

## What is Wireline Engineering?

**Wireline Engineering** involves the deployment of specialized tools and instruments into oil and gas wells using an electric cable (wireline). This technology enables real-time data acquisition for formation evaluation, well integrity assessment, and production optimization. 

Wireline operations include:
- **Open-hole logging**: Measuring rock properties before casing installation
- **Cased-hole logging**: Evaluating completed wells through steel casing
- **Intervention services**: Perforating, plug setting, fishing operations, and remedial work

## What is Tubing Conveyed Perforating (TCP)?

**Tubing Conveyed Perforating (TCP)** is a completion technique that creates holes through well casing and cement into the reservoir rock to establish communication between the wellbore and hydrocarbon-bearing formations. 

TCP systems use shaped charges containing high explosives deployed on tubing strings, offering:
- Precise depth control and positioning
- Multiple zone perforating capability
- Immediate post-perforation flow testing
- Superior performance in deviated wells and high-pressure environments

## How Are Explosives Used in Perforating Operations?

### Shaped Charge Technology

**Shaped Charges** are precision-engineered devices that form the core technology in both wireline and TCP operations. These contain high explosives strategically designed to focus explosive energy.

### What Types of Explosives Are Used?

- **HMX (Cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine)**
  - Primary explosive with high detonation velocity (~9,100 m/s)
  - Excellent temperature stability for deep well applications
  
- **RDX (Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine)**
  - Consistent performance with detonation velocity of ~8,750 m/s
  - Reliable initiation characteristics
  
- **PETN (Pentaerythritol tetranitrate)**
  - Used in detonating cord and boosters
  - Ensures reliable explosive train initiation

### How Does the Perforation Process Work?

When detonated, the shaped charge creates a high-velocity metal jet (typically copper or steel liner) that:

1. Penetrates through steel casing (typically 5-9 inches)
2. Cuts through cement sheath (2-4 inches)
3. Creates tunnels into formation rock (12-40+ inches)

The explosive energy is focused through a conical metal liner, with perforation tunnel diameter and penetration depth directly impacting well productivity by creating optimal flow paths from the reservoir into the wellbore.

## Why Are Safety Protocols Critical?

**Explosive handling** requires stringent safety measures including:
- Proper storage and transportation procedures
- Controlled assembly environments
- Adherence to international explosive regulations
- Compliance with local HSE standards
- Extensive personnel training and certification

Modern operations increasingly incorporate fiber-optic technology for real-time monitoring and advanced shaped charge designs for optimized reservoir connectivity, while maintaining the highest safety standards due to the inherent risks of explosive materials and high-pressure downhole environments.
