Six-month specialized training in tubing conveyed perforating (TCP) and wireline operations for oil & gas well completion and intervention.

## Highlights
- Designed and executed TCP operations using shaped charge technology for reservoir access and flow optimization.
- Performed wireline logging operations (open-hole and cased-hole) for formation evaluation and well integrity assessment.
- Handled high explosives (HMX, RDX, PETN) following strict safety protocols and regulatory compliance procedures.
- Supported well intervention services including perforating, plug setting, fishing operations, and remedial work.

## Tools & Skills
- TCP system design and deployment; shaped charge selection and positioning.
- Wireline operations (logging, intervention); explosive handling and safety protocols.
- Formation evaluation and well completion optimization; real-time data acquisition and analysis.

## What is Wireline Engineering?

**Wireline Engineering** involves the deployment of specialized tools and instruments into oil and gas wells using an electric cable (wireline). This technology enables real-time data acquisition for formation evaluation, well integrity assessment, and production optimization. 

Wireline operations include:
- **Open-hole logging**: Measuring rock properties before casing installation
- **Cased-hole logging**: Evaluating completed wells through steel casing
- **Intervention services**: Perforating, plug setting, fishing operations, and remedial work

## What is Tubing Conveyed Perforating (TCP)?

**Tubing Conveyed Perforating (TCP)** is a completion technique that creates holes through well casing and cement into the reservoir rock to establish communication between the wellbore and hydrocarbon-bearing formations. 

TCP systems use shaped charges containing high explosives deployed on tubing strings, offering:
- Precise depth control and positioning
- Multiple zone perforating capability
- Immediate post-perforation flow testing
- Superior performance in deviated wells and high-pressure environments

## How Are Explosives Used in Perforating Operations?

### Shaped Charge Technology

**Shaped Charges** are precision-engineered devices that form the core technology in both wireline and TCP operations. These contain high explosives strategically designed to focus explosive energy.

### What Types of Explosives Are Used?

- **HMX (Cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine)**
  - Primary explosive with high detonation velocity (~9,100 m/s)
  - Excellent temperature stability for deep well applications
  
- **RDX (Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine)**
  - Consistent performance with detonation velocity of ~8,750 m/s
  - Reliable initiation characteristics
  
- **PETN (Pentaerythritol tetranitrate)**
  - Used in detonating cord and boosters
  - Ensures reliable explosive train initiation

### How Does the Perforation Process Work?

When detonated, the shaped charge creates a high-velocity metal jet (typically copper or steel liner) that:
1. Penetrates through steel casing (typically 5-9 inches)
2. Cuts through cement sheath (2-4 inches)
3. Creates tunnels into formation rock (12-40+ inches)

The explosive energy is focused through a conical metal liner, with perforation tunnel diameter and penetration depth directly impacting well productivity by creating optimal flow paths from the reservoir into the wellbore.

## Why Are Safety Protocols Critical?

**Explosive handling** requires stringent safety measures including:
- Proper storage and transportation procedures
- Controlled assembly environments
- Adherence to international explosive regulations
- Compliance with local HSE standards
- Extensive personnel training and certification

Modern operations increasingly incorporate fiber-optic technology for real-time monitoring and advanced shaped charge designs for optimized reservoir connectivity, while maintaining the highest safety standards due to the inherent risks of explosive materials and high-pressure downhole environments.
